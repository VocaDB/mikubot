<p>
	Modules are separated into two major categories: active modules (command modules) and passive modules.
</p>
<p>
	Active modules are activated by calling them explicitly.
	Most module commands may be activated in 3 different ways: by using a server-specific shortcut, by highlighting the bot, or by PM'ing the bot.
	Using the shortcut is the simplest way. You prefix the desired command with the server-specific shortcut which can be obtained with the Help command.
	For example, if the shortcut key is !, you activate a command named Help by posting !help to a channel where the bot is on.
	Highlighting the bot works similarly, but instead of a shortcut prefix, you prefix the command with the bot's nick followed by a colon and optional whitespace. For example,
	if the bot's nickname is MikuBot, command named Help can be activated by calling MikuBot:help (whitespace before and after the colon is ignored).
	The bot can also be called via private messages (PM). In this case no prefix is needed. Please note that not all commands can be activated via PM.
	Some commands are channel-specific and must be activated on a channel. There are also commands that must always be sent via PM.

	Passive modules cannot be activated directly. They either monitor the channel or react to specific keywords or events.
