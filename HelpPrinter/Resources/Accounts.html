<p>The bot has 4 access levels: Unidentified, Identified, Manager and Admin. 
Most commands are available to unidentified users and require no account. 
Certain commands require basic idenfication and advanced commands either manager 
or admin access. You can always check your current access level using the 
'authenticate' command without any parameters. Both 'help' and 'commands' 
commands only show the commands that you have access to.</p>
<p>Currently the bot has two ways for authenticating users: preconfigured keys 
and VocaDB Access Keys. Preconfigured keys need to be added by the bot 
administrator and they are for limited use only, such as adding more 
administrators. Normal users get basic access by registering to VocaDB. Every 
VocaDB account has a unique access key that can be found at Profile -&gt; My 
Settings -&gt; Connectivity. That key is supplied to the 'VocaDbAuth' command along 
with the user's username.</p>
