	MikuBot is modular, meaning most of its functionality is provided by individual modules. 
	These modules can be enabled, disabled and updated independently of each other without restarting the bot.

	The bot can parse many common links posted on the channel and display information about these links. Supported services include Youtube, NicoNicoDouga, danbooru, gelbooru and VocaDB.
	Using the link recorder module, the bot can record all links posted on the channel. There is a related website for displaying the feed of links posted on a certain channel.
	The bot can also be queried whether a specific link has been posted before. The bot can be used to query artist, album and song information from VocaDB. When a PV from
	Youtube or NicoNicoDouga is posted, the bot can get the information from VocaDB instead of the video streaming service.
